# Introduction
In this project, I analyze the liked songs on my spotify account. This is a project created purely out of personal interest. I like music, both playing and listening to it, but my tastes are fairly limited. While I have reflected on my taste in music from a qualitative point of view, I hadn't really analyzed it quantitatively. 

# Contents
The repository contains the following
* liked_songs.csv - a csv file containing the data used for analysis
* spotify_api.py - used to retrieve the data. Note I deleted OAuth keys before pushing.
* liked_spotify_songs.ipynb - notebook containing analysis
