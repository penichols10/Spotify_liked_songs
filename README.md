# Introduction
In this project, I analyze the liked songs on my spotify account. This is a project created purely out of personal interest. I like music, both playing and listening to it, but my tastes are fairly limited. While I have reflected on my taste in music from a qualitative point of view, I hadn't really analyzed it quantitatively. Given I listen to a lot of metal, some offensive or edgy song/album/artist names might make it into the notebook, although I've done my best to minimize that. I find all of that type of stuff pretty immature and do not endorse it.
